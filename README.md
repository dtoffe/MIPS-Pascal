This repository contains the complete source code of a Pascal compiler developed at MIPS Computer Systems in the early 80s that received some enhancements from the Pascal derived language Pastel, developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as part of the development of the S-1 project in the late 70s.

Directory **\libp** contains the runtime library developed in the C language.

Directory **\upas** contains the compiler source code developed in the MIPS Pascal Language.
